# AT-IT
Adventure Time: Dungeon Train is platformer game developed for the final project of Game Development 2023

Hello and thank you for giving this little fan game a chance. I know the repo says A TIT, but it's only because I forgot the actual name of the episode of Adventure Time from which this game's inspiration comes from. I thought it was Infinity Train, which is also the name of a show with an emotional writing akin to Adventure Time. As of writing this, I currently just have the menus ready. But the style is level based, where you start off fighting small level enemies in small train cars, then progressively go through harder enemies and bigger train cars. As you progress, enemies drop loot and/or points for the player to spend on upgrades or new/rotating loot. There will eventually be character customization through unlocking achievements, and progression will allow you to change to different characters (Jake, Princess Bubble Gum, Marceline, BMO, peppermint Butler; characters subject to change) Unlocking characters unlocks new train cars that aesthetically match the character that unlocked with it (Vampire theme for Marceline for example). Health bar is point based, 1 damage is 1 health lost. Each character has there own unique weapon, and new styles for their weapons can be unlocked through achievements.
